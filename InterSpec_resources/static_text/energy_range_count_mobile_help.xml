This tool allows you to determine how much the foreground and/or secondary spectrum
differs from the background for a given energy range.

This tool can be useful to determine if there is an elevated continuum due to a
beta source, neutron interactions, other other causes that can elevate the continuum.<br />
If the foreground, secondary, and/or background do not have the same live times,
the counts will be normalized by the live-time before calculating differences.
However, the statistical uncertainties are based on the original number of counts.
