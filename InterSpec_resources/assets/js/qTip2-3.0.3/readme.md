Just the 'dist' folder, with 'basic' sub-folder removed.

wcjohns added fix taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66694407/qtip2-doesnt-work-with-jquery-3-6-elem-getclientrects-is-not-a-function#answer-66695175 to work with jQuery 3.6.0.
wcjohns also removed some plugins not used in jquery.qtip.js, and then minimized the JS to make jquery.qtip.min.js
