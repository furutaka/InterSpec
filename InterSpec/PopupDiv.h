//Limitations of enabling USE_OSX_NATIVE_MENU or USING_ELECTRON_NATIVE_MENU:
//  -disabling the closing of the menu when an item is selected isn't supported.
//  -CheckBox items must be created through passing a WCheckBox to
//   PopupDivMenu::addWidget(...).
//  -Only WCheckBox is supported by PopupDivMenu::addWidget(...), adding any
//   other widget to, or as, a menu item is not supported.
//  -USE_OSX_NATIVE_MENU implementation casts the objective-c pointers to void*
//   pointers, I tried doing some forward declartions using things similar to
//   'typedef struct objc_object NSMenu', but then ran into linking errors.
//  -USING_ELECTRON_NATIVE_MENU implementation currently expects top level menus
//   to already exist (probably easy to fix).
